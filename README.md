## General Information
This project aims to build a linear regression model to predict the number of bikes required to meet the demand for a bike-sharing system. The dataset used in this project is from the Bike Sharing Assignment provided by UpGrad. The objective of the project is to create a model that accurately predicts the demand for shared bikes.


<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The demand for shared bikes is highly influenced by variables like temperature, humidity, and windspeed.
- The model built has an R-squared value of 0.81, which indicates that 81% of the variance in the demand for shared bikes can be explained by the variables in the model.
- The assumptions of linear regression, such as linearity, normality, homoscedasticity, and independence, were validated after building the model on the training set.
